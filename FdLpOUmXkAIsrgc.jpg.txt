INAF 576:
Liberal Democracy in Crisis
Fall 2022
Tuesdays 9:30 — 12:00

Course Outline

The idea that liberal democracy is experiencing a severe crisis
currently dominates much of the political, academic, and
broader media discourses. Brexit in Great Britain, the election
of Donald Trump in the United States, the success of the AfD
in Germany and similar far-right parties all over Western
Europe, and the rise of “populists” in Hungary, Poland,
Turkey, and elsewhere — they all seem to indicate strong
authoritarian leanings amongst the broader electorate in the
“West” and a dangerous amount of skepticism towards the
foundations of liberal democracy. What does the historical
perspective contribute to a better understanding of our current
predicament? We start by analyzing the diagnoses presented
by politicians and journalists, social and political scientists as
well as social and political psychologists and examine how
they have interpreted the “crisis.” Next, we look at previous
phases in the history of the twentieth century when democracy
seemed to be in crisis — in the interwar period and in particular
after the global economic crisis; or in the 1970s, when a series
of economic “shocks” and powerful protest movements
seemed to conspire to make democracies “ungovernable” —
and reflect on the lessons that can (or should not) be drawn
from such moments. Finally, we explore the origins of the
current “crisis,” focusing on possible longer- and medium-
term causes such as the global financial / economic crisis of
2008/9, the dramatic demographic and cultural changes that
most of the affected societies are undergoing, or the role of
globalization.
